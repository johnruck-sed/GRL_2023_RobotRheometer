# GRL_2023_RobotRheometer

The information contained in this repository is for the purpose of code and data availability for Ruck et al., 2023 "Downslope weakening of soil revealed by a rapid robotic rheometer"

For field data collected using the robot intrusion leg, following the protcols outlined in the "Field study" section of Ruck et al., 2023, please navigate to the "field_data" folder.

For laboratory data collected using the robot intrusion leg, following protocols outlined in the "Experimental setup and laboratory study" section of Ruck et al., 2023, please navigate to the "lab_data" folder.

To access the Python code written to process both laboratory and field data, please navigate to the "juypter_notebooks" folder. This folder contains the code used for producing plots seen in Fig. 1b, Fig. 2d, Fig. 3a, and Figure 4, as well as all of the supplemental figures.

To access the Matlab code written to process both laboratory and field data, please navigate to the "matlab_files" folder. This folder contains the code used for producing plots seen in Fig. 2c and Fig. 3b.
